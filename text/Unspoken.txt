Dear Unknown Friend,
<br><br>
How does it feel? How does it feel to be close to her? Does her touch feels like flower petals? Does she blinks like butterfly wing? Does she have the fragrance of a fountain? Does her hand feel like the first warmth of a winter fire? Does her hair feel like autumn breeze?
<br><br>Honestly, I will never know. I can only imagine. You are truly lucky. Or maybe, I am the one with the defects. They lie to us about many things. They say art and language are a form of expression. But then why she never understood? Or was it me who failed? Why? Why I could never speak? I know, all it takes is a few words, few words wrapped in truth. But why it never came out? Why my heart and my mind stopped me so many times?
<br><br>May be fate knew that she loved you more than me. The way she looks at you, explains everything. I was and always will be a ghost to her. She never noticed. She never will. And now that destiny has merged you together, time for me to decide mine. And I decide never to speak again. I decide to hide my thoughts forever and through my heart into the shallow darkness that I always deserved. I wish great fortune for both of you. And what was unspoken stays unspoken forever.
<br><br>Yoursâ€¦
