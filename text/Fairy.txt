I can see you. Yes! I can! You are the one right? Who came in my dreams! I remember your touch, your feel, your love. Fairy from my dreams, what is your name? Why your touch feels so cold? I can feel you on me, I can see your wings glittering and blinding my eyes, I can see... Why don't you have any face? I can feel you eating my flesh. I can feel your teeth tearing my skin. It feels so cold. My bones are open to you. Taste them and devour my insides. Leave behind the hollow that I truly am. Leave my husk in this darkness and fly away with my soul.
