The fights are over. No. Nor the war with bombs and guns between Countries and Men, neither between God vs Satan. The fight is within me. Good and Evil, both represent the God and the Devil. Too much to take. Life gives us moral decisions which reflects what we are, what we can be. But, it's over. I am in peace. I am happy. I Gave In to the flow of life and Gave Up to to the struggles. I just don't care any more. Being happy with simple things, No Expectations, No Needs, No "I want that", No Love, No nothing. The God and the Devil smoke weed with me, and stay happy. The only thing that brings temporary Joy to my Heart and permanent Memory Loss to my Brain, the only thing that can make me Smile, is the white magical smoke that surrounds my consciousness and blurring the harsh reality.
