What do you see around you? How do you construct your life and surroundings? How it may seem, it is never decided by you.
<br><br>They say, "surround yourself by happy people". Truth is the so called, "happy people" are the ones who lets me crawl upon my bubble. They laugh, I can't. They fall in love, I can't. They enjoy, I can't. Every thing that's make me happy is taken away always, and things that stayed made my bubble darker and darker. That is society to me.
