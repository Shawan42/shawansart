What is true emptiness? What is the true feeling of despair? People think that not finding love is emptiness. Some find that not having wealth is empty, some think a mountain of money is empty. To people, not having someone's lap to rest your head on is empty. May be too much leisure is empty. Some think that repeating certain work again and again is empty. Being pathetic might also be empty.
<br><br>But what if there is no heart? What if you cannot feel love? What if all you have is regret? Despair is not the short time you feel down. It is like a hole. There is a hollow inside my heart that can never be filled. There is no escape from true despair. As the days pass, I feel emptier inside. It feels like, there is no heart at all. Those who shattered my heart, or those who made it beat faster, they are powerless to me. I feel, Nothing! Nothing at all! It doesnâ€™t make me sad. It makes me afraid.
