As Nawab, the British Lord and his Darbaar laughed and chattered on the scattering golden and red environment, and the suitors tried to maintain balance with their mood, fountain of Hooch and Scotch intoxicated the Mehfil. A group of older men can be seen on a corner drinking like a thirsty Musafir from dessert. A few young men can be seen with their own Harem of Daasis surrounding them with no clothes on upper body. In this very toxic, sexual and illusive party, enters a woman covered in pink, red and gold. Her walking got the attention of both men and women present there. All became silent as her jingling footsteps echoed in the large hall. Her body enchanted men and crooked women as her eyes expressed deep sorrow and renouncement. She posed on the middle of the room and opened her lips to through the voice. Her Senhai like voice created a reverb of desire all over, the lord could only utter one single word. “Mashallah !!!!”
