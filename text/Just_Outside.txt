A long week had passed. One Friday afternoon, she sat by the window, just taking a break. A soft breeze passed through her hair, as if it were saying hello. Just outside, a boy wearing a school uniform was feeding a dog some biscuits. He... he was kinda cute. Those pinkish cheeks and messy hair reminded her of someone from her school days.

Not so long ago were the days when she was a well-known dancer. Her moves used to captivate others, but deep inside, she always felt nervous. Not because of stage fright—oh no! While others admired her, she would lock gazes with a certain someone. Someone who made her heart race just a little faster. And he always looked at her with a dumbfounded expression. She thought he would ask her out someday, but...

Ah! It's a call. Time for another boring meeting. Wait, is the boy looking at her? His mouth slightly open. Silly boy, kinda cute.
<br><br>
What’s that?<br>
The heart... is it beating again?<br>
Maybe. Just maybe...
