<br><br>Sometimes I find myself surrounded by people who are happy and welcoming. And people who know how to connect and bond with each other. It is truly great to see friends finding and falling in love. They find their true partner and care for each other and that makes me happy. But I do realize that time and love passes through and I remain the guy who just doesn’t fit. I became the broken piece of the puzzle.
<br><br>Warmth of hugs, smiles of caring, hands of support… all these are just a foreign concept to me.
<br><br>I became the one with the broken chain. The one with defect. Disconnected from the world forever.
