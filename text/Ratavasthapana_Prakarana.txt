"In the beginning, the Lord of Beings created men and women, and in the form of commandments in one hundred thousand verses, laid down rules for regulating their existence with regard to dharma, artha and kama. Some of these commandments, such as those which dealt with dharma, were written separately by Swayambhu Manu; those that related to artha were compiled by Brihaspati; and those that referred to kama were expounded by Nandikeshvara, the follower of Mahadeva."    -Kamasutra
