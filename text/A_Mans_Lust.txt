In every mythological text or image, Lust is depicted as a woman. I don’t know why. A man’s desire is ignored as it might be seen as a natural thing. It is natural for a man to be a hunk about sexual nature. An alpha male or some dominant mindless monster, who has no sexual preference and is vulnerable to every bodily gesture and touch.

Yes! Men can be vulnerable. Men can be in a deep sexual depression. Men are not mindless creatures. Men can feel the void of attention, the pain of losing a certain person’s interest. Men can also feel jealousy and can try to win heart through tough changes that might never be compatible with him. And despite of doing everything he can, when he is ignored, men can also be thrown to dreadful nature of bodily rejection or sexual depression. Suicidal thoughts, mental and physical discomfort, all these can open the path for being Masochist.
