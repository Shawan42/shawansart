It took me straight Six Months. Six months to reach the forbidden land of the west. Never thought it would be this much tough. But the book said to follow the river, and I did. Until, I reached the land. Dusty yet foggy, brown sky above my head looking likes post-apocalyptic earth around me. It was dry and dead. But the book and the map said this was the land. I was confused. What the Hell?
<br><br>Well who would’ve thought? Hell it was. The cold breeze chilling me to my bones. I read that so called “God” stays here. I wanted many things. Like a greedy bastard, I wanted woman, and money. Lots and Lots of money. I wanted to become the King of the world. Well, who doesn’t want that? I walked to the marked location on my map. But…
<br><br>There was No God. But there was a dead body up the rock. Crucified. I thought it was a bad joke. I was angry, frustrated to my limits, but then I saw it. There wasn’t two but four arms of that skeleton. And… Three… Three fucking head. Golden ornaments still shiny but the skeleton was almost a thousand year old…
<br><br>What the Fuck? There was no sign of life in that area. Only…. Vultures
