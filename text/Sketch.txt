Do wishes come true? I wonder!
<br><br>Sometimes, I think I am alone. The only person who feels this way. The only person whose life becomes more blue and gray everyday. But then I turn my head. And see those who are black and even those who are gone. I am becoming like them.
<br><br>I am a sinner. Envy is my primary sin. I am envious to those who can smile, to those who are happy and are bright. I am envious to them who has you.
<br><br>Though I see through my mind's window and I draw you with all my heart, as I become more and more blue day by day. My heart and mind will one day become grey and black and life will make me forget you.
<br><br>That is my wish.
