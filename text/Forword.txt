Get Up, Get up from this pit. Come back. Look up as there is hope. I understand that you are tired and dead inside. I know you are looking for hope. I know you want to rise from the pit of black ooze and you want to make yourself unstuck. So Get Up.... Get Up..... Get THE FUCKING UUUUUPPPPP..... Why are you not moving? What happened to your body? When the hope finally arrived, why are you so slumber? Why the hell are you not moving? Why is the goo keeping you stuck? What has happened to you?.... Keep trying
