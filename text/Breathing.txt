Why? Why can't I stop myself from wishing you within my arms? I have forgotten you. Haven't I? Still, I just can't stop thinking about the way you smile. The way you look at the distant mountains with a calm yet bright look, wanting to be like clouds touching the snowy top. I can't ignore that look. Why do I want to hold you within my arms? I want to wiff your neck and be drunk with the hypnotic fragrance of your body. I want to press my lips on your neck and feel the twitching when my warm breath flows on your neck. I want to press my ears to your heart and listen to the rhythm of passion that will ripple through my skin and match my heart. Do you know about all these wishes that I have when you smile and greet me good mornings? You don't. You don't know how I sigh out the wishes when you bid me good-bye.
