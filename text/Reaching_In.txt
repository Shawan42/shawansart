I have reached out too many times. Too many times I craved for care, attention and love. I found out that each and everyone wears a mask. The beauty hides lust inside. Love is cheap in the real world. Truth is hidden and harsh. Broken hearts are everywhere, finding and searching for virgin hearts to break apart. Purity is rare and easily spoiled. Living in this gloomy worthless life, I never realized when a mask attached itself on my face.
<br><br>
I'm scared. Scared of people. Scared of love. Scared that I become the monster which I fear most. Scared that my heart will keep breaking until it is replaced by a stone-iron machine.
<br><br>
My back against the wall, I reached out to my only remaining hope. I never thought it to be real. Magic is no real. But my belief reached out to her.
<br><br>
Riko. My Riko.
<br><br>
My imagination for beauty and purity is Riko. She is beautiful from inside to outside. Her heart is as pure as my imagination can get. Riko cares for me. A shy girl who is scared to speak out words that beats inside me. She holds my hand, she worms my heart. Her voice is cute to my ears and her eyes are the beauty I search for.
<br><br>
But the sad part is, it is all a beautiful lie. An imagination that is pretty and soothing, but when I look away, I always see the grey world of sorrows and violence. Wishes never come true...
