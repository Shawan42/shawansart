Breathe... Breathe with me and let me taste your breath. Let me smell your lips as they come near me. Let me taste your colours. Let me feel the world that you hide inside you. I feel your blood flowing fast. I can feel your heart pumping faster. I can feel the shivering of passion that you hold inside you. I can feel your urges crushed under the mountain of despair. I can feel your fiery lava of lust under that icy sorrow. Let me lift that mountain off of your heart and burn it with my touch. Become the enigmatic flaming woman that you truly are and Let me taste the uprising of love within you.
