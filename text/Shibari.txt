Something is happening. Feeling tight bonds all over the body, it's... painful. Feel the pain of gravity and the stretching of bones. Feeling the crackling joints all over and the skin heating up. So tight, so deep. Skin bulging out and exposed to the world, it's... sensational. Feel the fear of exposure, fear of getting touched, fear of falling down, fear of... vulnerability. Yet, it's addicting. The pleasure of submitting to this bondage ties up to the extent that the mouth vomits out pure bodily love. The fulfillment felt by submitting to the dominance is burning from the pressure of the ropes tightening as the body hangs from above. Tied up and blinded, the only feeling there is, is the purity of bodily pain, just waiting to be released or exploited by the one doing... Shibari.
