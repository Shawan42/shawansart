After a devastating Failure, a complete Heartbreak, an unspoken Pain, an unexpressed Feelings, an unforgiving Memory and everything that brings Tears in my Eyes and Pain in my Heart.
<br><br>The only thing that brings temporary Joy to my Heart and permanent Memory Loss to my Brain, the only thing that can make me Smile, is the white magical smoke that surrounds my consciousness and blurring the harsh reality.
<br><br>Thus I am Alone and I Smile.
<br><br>That Does not mean I am Happy.
