 -"So, I heard you have a new partner in life... Good for you."
<br><br>
She smiled looking at me, tilting her head, as she always did. She changed a little bit, I see she wears glasses now, looks good on her as usual. She cut her hair a little bit, making her look young and more astonishing. I suppressed my urge to gaze at her, looked away and said,
<br><br>
-"Yes. It's been two months."
<br><br>
-"Nice" she said, giving me a cheeky look, "You have become quite a man indeed."
<br><br>
I wanted to say, "so you noticed?" but I said,
<br><br>
-"Thank you"
<br><br>
-"So what do you love about her?"
<br><br>
-"She's cute."
<br><br>
But I wanted to burst. I wanted to scream out and say, "Why is it not you? why you had to be so cold and neglecting towards me? You want to know? I love her because she reminds me of you."
