"Human cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The meaning of 'cannibalism' has been extended into zoology to describe an individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism."
