 The graveyards or the cemeteries are pretty quiet. So I spend most of my time there. There is no counting how many bodies I have seen. But I never saw any ghosts or spirits or what ever it may be. Maybe I hope to see them someday.

Many things happen in a secluded place. This is the day when I saw four boys pulling and carrying a big sack on their back. They did something about it in a place behind the bushes, and then left. I went there and saw that the soil had been dug. Again that day I saw a family come to burn a body. What I understood from a distance was that it was the body of a child. People were crying, a woman crying and spreading her arms and legs like she wants her toy back. Many also wished peace for the soul. Doesn't the soul get peace?

Many say that after death, people travel to the afterlife. But that is not true. I saw. When the corpse is burnt, all the skin and flesh are on fire, leaving only ashes and some bones. And coffin is another funny thing. The body becomes pale when covered. And black spots seen on the bottom. Then on the hard body it looks like there are white maggots. They continue to eat the body and fill it with glue and water like squishy substance. Those insects love skin and rotten meat. And at the end of the bone that is left behind, it is very slowly leaking. And those holes and stigmas keep growing and the bones keep mixing with the ground. And whatever is in the end, it is better to call it dust. Most surprisingly, a flower grows on that dusty smelly soil.

It seems strange to think of different customs in different cultures. Some burn it, some cover it in ground with cloth. Someone does coffin. Somewhere the body is left in a high place as the vultures come and feast on it.

Whatever it is, it irritates me. Sir said he would fire me if I didn't get at least two deaths in a second. It's a 24-7 job with pay I don't know what is yet. My job? I'll tell you when we meet. My name? Don't know. But those white people call me Reaper. I don't know the meaning.
