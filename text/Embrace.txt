What happens when hold someone close to us? Close to our skin, our body and our heart? Can't remember. It's been like ages maybe. I do not remember the feeling. The feeling of the heat that caresses my heart. That calms my raging body and warms the cold heart. Why does my body feels this wanting? This pain and this urge? Sometimes, it wants run away from all the pain. Other times it wants to feel the pain. All the bruises, all the marks, the cuts, they want to be kissed. They want to feel, wanted. Maybe it is me, who want to feel wanted. Wanted and needed by someone who would feel the same ache when I am not near. Maybe, it is never going to happen. What my body feels is mine and mine own. And my wishes will eventually fade away. I hope, 
<br><br>I will fade with them too.
