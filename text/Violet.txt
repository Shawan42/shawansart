Let us be one. Let us unite in this gloomy and somber world and splatter a tinge of passionate vivid bloom. Let me taste your tears; let me caress your sorrowful lips; let me hear the rhythm of your racing heart and let me touch the tremor of your quivering skin. For I shall hold you within my arms and let you be as blue as you yearn to be. Let me glow crimson red with your warm embrace and let me saturate you with this fiery hot glow. You, the blue one, you have the gift of fire. Burn my coal-black core, burn my rigid shell of impassiveness, burn my harshness and bathe under this consuming flame. For we shall transcend, we will forge the richest spectrum. For we shall become the embodiment of passion, pain, and beauty intertwined. We will rise as the proud, warm violet.
