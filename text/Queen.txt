The Princess becomes The Queen.<br>
<br>As the flowers kiss her feet, the wind touches her hair and spread the news all over the nation. The marriage is complete. The Princess is now the Queen and Prince becomes the King. After a long wait, she finally holds the hand of her Love and blushes with mixed emotions. Nature made them a bridge as kingdom shines with joy of unity. The ground trembles with the sound of â€œAll hail the King and Queen". The sun hides behind the mountains as their shadows fade away.
<br>But somewhere, a lonely Jester smiles from a distant grey corner as a drop of dream wets his eyes. As the red rose sheds a petal, his heart breaks into pieces. No one could hear, no one could know. As he hold the painting he made for her beloved, his mind whispered to him,
<br><br>"Oh mighty fate, I ask you this,<br>
Why the world has so many rules?<br>
Why is the sky has gifts of stars,<br>
And crowns are marked with Jewels?<br>
When did the flower bloomed and shined,<br>
When did the bird learn to fly?<br>
Why does a king is born to rule,<br>
And soldiers born to die?<br>
Why does a princess dreams of a prince,<br>
And a jester has no right to dream?<br>
All these years I loved you and I will,<br>
Only if my thoughts could scream"<br>
He holds the painting to his chest. Only if, the world could knew, only if she ever knew...
