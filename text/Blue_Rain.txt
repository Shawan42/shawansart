Worst thing about rain is,<br>
It makes me want to love...<br>
<br><br>
It makes me want to look down. It makes me want to crave attention. It makes my heart become cold just the right amount to want the warmth of another person. It makes me remember things that I want to forget. It makes me imagine thoughts that I want to avoid. It is frustrating how the grey view, humid air, cold drops and black skies provoke such lush and tingling feelings. All the more reason, I hate rain.
