The following is the letter attached to the parcel....
<br><br>To
<br><br>Someone I wish,
<br><br>Oh, My Love. I will always be with You. My love shall never die, even if I breath my Last.
I have been rejected from the beginning. Rejected from the world, rejected by the God, by the society and mostly by you. But it doesn't matter. You have never understood how much I want you. And it's all right. I am happy. As my gifts make you smile for a bit, I become the happiest person alive. You will never know who I am. What I am. For your heart belongs to someone else.
<br>But still, I will try. One day will come when you will know that no one can be yours more than me. I have tried to win your heart with songs, sketches and other things. Hope you love them. This time I gifted my life to you my precious. My heart, Belongs to you.
<br><br>-Yours Forever
