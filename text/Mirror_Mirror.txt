Mirror mirror tell me now,<br>
Where does he want to hit me and how?<br>
Does he want to punch my eyes?<br>
Or he wanna cut my thighs?<br>
The ugly monster keeps his grim,<br>
Is that me or is it, Him?<br>
You know the one inside my mind,<br>
Shattered my thoughts and made me blind...<br>
He wants my blood and my tears,<br>
And whispers blackness in my ears.<br>
He is the man who hates me the most,<br>
Oh mirror, he is inside you, like a ghost.
