What are we? Who are we? Sometimes I sit on the Chair. Relentlessly think. Think, that we might Just be a Multi-Celled Organism, created to spread war and hatred. Or, we might be some kind of intelligent animal, born to multiply beyond nature.
<br><br>We are obsessed with Delusions based on Peace, Truth, News, Curiosity, Care, Trust, SMILE. We live in Illusions of Love, Family, Politics, Science, GOD...
<br><br>But in the end, my friend, we are just layers of Skin, Flesh, Muscle-Tissues, Bones, Neurons, and Thoughts. Lots and Lots of UGLY THOUGHTS. Nothing more. Nothing else.
