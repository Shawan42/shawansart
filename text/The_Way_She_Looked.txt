Dreams are very cruel. They show us something that we crave and they thrive upon our happiness. In one such dream I saw her. Her hair was like black waves of wonder. Her body spoke to me, as if it asked me to come near and wanted me to stay away at the same time. Her dark ebony skin shined in the colures, reflecting the rainbows and yet radiated with power. She was walking in front of me. Her walk created ripples through the air and yet, it was like a flower smoothly jiggling in the air.
She turned around. Her lips spoke a thousand words just by staying closed. Her face was like an ancient goddess which represented the beauty of all human with one straight look. And her look. Her eyes pierced through my heart. It was like she attacked me, alienated me from her world. But still, it was like she was curious about my thoughts. She wanted to know me and yet she wanted me t stay away.
After that dream, all I had was sadness. A heavy weight anchored on my heart and I never wanted to dream but yet, wanted to see her again. Why did you did this to me?
