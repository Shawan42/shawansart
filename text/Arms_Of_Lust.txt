What?...
<br><br>Where.. Where am I?
<br><br>What is this feeling?? What is this feeling of wanting that is running through my skin? I feel the burning pain deep within my heart and this hunger that wants to get the comfort of another human body.
<br><br>my heart wants to be touched. My layers want to be caressed. My hair wants to be tight. My brain wants to die.
<br><br>I can't see, hear, smell or taste. All I can do is feel. My body wants to be grabbed. Tortured!!!
<br><br>Pain... I want to feel the pain within my heart. I want to feel the pain on my skin. I want to bleed all over as I die in the arms of desire. I want them to tear me apart. Eat my organs. And all I want in return is the never ending pleasure in return.
<br><br>Please... Kill me with your lust. Let me die over your ice cold heart and on your scorching torso. Let my body melt with your deep breaths and mend me with your passion. Let me burn. Please.
