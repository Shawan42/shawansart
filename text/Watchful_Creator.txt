You will see him. When you reach the top of the mountain, sit down. Calm your body and mind and close your eyes. Concentrate. Concentrate on a single point. Concentrate on the singularity that created the universe. Breath. Keep going. Do not stop until you hear it. Untill you hear the entity called “God” breath. An ear shattering heavy sound that will almost eliminate all the sounds of the world. All you will hear, is a heavy earthy dark and deep sound, which might feel like the sound of a thousand earthquake. Slowly, very slowly, open your eyes. Look up to the sky, and you will see him.
<br><br>
The watchful eye looking at you, looking at all of us. It will almost block the sun, but you will be able to see him. The large planetary yet very skinny body covering earth, and a single eye. What ever happens, Do Not look away. Do not disrespect. Fear it. Bow before it. Do not speak. Think the words. Do not question. And to get freedom, just close your eyes, and open. It will be gone. You have seen the truth. And you now know the truth. The question is, can you live with it?
