 As the eyes look at each other deeper, as they grow close to the lashes of the other, we can feel it. As our breathing creates a hurricane of emotions, and our warm breath mixes, we can feel it. Arms embracing the very presence just to express the urge to stay, the urge to want, the urge to be one, we can feel it. Our heart beats overlap each other and creates the very orchestra of rhythmic bumps, we can feel it. Tilted nose, grabbed cheeks, and finally, we can feel it. We can feel our lips getting close and touching each other. The soft pressure and pushed pouts. The overly addictive warmth that creates a strong bond forces us to stay. Don't let go of me. Don't stop. Can you feel the conversation that is subconsciously happening with the action of lips? Cause I feel I can hear you. The will, to kiss me.
