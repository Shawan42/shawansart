Please, grab my hand. Reach for me; let me free you from these bindings. I just can't stand all the iron that binds you. All these golden and velvety ornaments that hide the chains of society and shackles of responsibilities. Let me break them up. Let me... Who am I to say? I myself am bound and burdened by the responsibilities. Freedom is a false concept to us, and all we think of as being free is just a mere movement of the nexus itself. As the blue tie fades, the golden tie is knotted around us. As we come together, the chains tighten and pull us even further apart. I am tired of running, tired of trying to break free, and tired of reaching out just to touch your fingers. Do you feel the same? Or is your leash stronger than mine? Do they let you move, even a little bit? Bound by the sore truth in the braod daylight. Going down deeper and deeper in our own minds. But I still hope. I still hope for freedom, and I still wait to see the free clouds. I still hope... Will you feel this hope with me?
