The colours you see are nothing but an illusion,<br>
The riches you see are nothing but a cover,<br>
The smile you see is nothing but a mask,<br>
And I burn myself over and over...<br>
I look at the mirror and see a mistake,<br>
I look at others an wish their lives,<br>
I look at my world and wish to change,<br>
And I tell myself nothing but lies...<br>
I try to be the one who snaches,<br>
I try to be the unstopable man,<br>
I try to take from others but fail,<br>
And I hatemyself as much as I can... <br>
