It is strange how we try to fine the one we love or loved in someone or something. Image that reminds us of those who made their mark on our heart. We create, search and maybe get involve with someone or something that is nostalgic to our heart. We find them through someone else's habits, voice, way of talking and many more. We find them through details like nose, chin, lips, mole, eyes and many more. We find them through objects like scent brand, foods they like, dolls, watches etc. We find them through art. Their favorite songs. Portrait.

It's painful to be an artist. When I try to make portrait from my mind, those details slide through the pens and brushes. It reminds me of them. It is painful indeed.
